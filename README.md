# campus-life-app
# Description
A web app that allows users to find information from public APIs such as campus events and food. This website uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap. The key purpose is to provide students with easy access to campus information in an instant.

# Instructions
1. Clone the repo to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/angelhb01/campus-life-app.git
```

2. Open the project directory
```
cd campus-life-app
```

3. Run a live server
VSCode liveserver extension

# Features
The website includes two main features:
- Events (campus events)
- Dining (food data and their description)

Once these features have been navigated, they will provide you information which comes from a public API.

# Future Improvements
- Gathering more data (data has been limited since it was quite difficult to gather specific information).
- Changing the layout of the website for a better look to it.
